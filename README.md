# Neural Network

Python implementation of fully connected neural network

Supporting layers and utilities include:

* Hidden layers: sigmoid, relu, and softmax
* Output layers: sigmoid and softmax
* Cost: quadratic, cross-entropy, and log-likelihood
* Regularization: L2 regularization and dropout
* Cost and classification accuracy tracking
